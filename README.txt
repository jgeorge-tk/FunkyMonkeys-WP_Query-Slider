A Free, Queryable, Highly Customizable, Touch Compatible and Responsive Content Slider with Widget. 

== Description ==
Before you say, "Oh no, not another slider plugin." please understand why I created this plugin. When it comes to content sliders, there is a lacking in highly customizable content sliders for worpress in the marketplace. I wanted to change that by integrating the absolute latest version of one of the most popular jquery carousel plugins named Owl-Carousel 2.0 to wordpress and maintain its ability to literally show any content I wanted I any fashion. It is a loft goal and mostly accomplished at this time. This plugin will activate both the ability to use shortcodes and/or widgets to post any content-type that can be queried through wp_query through the owl-carousel 2.0 jquery plugin. It uses the exact formatting for wp_query to determine what posts/post-types it shows, or any other setting that can be determined through that function. Basically this plugin perfectly integrates the owl-carousel 2.0 and it's settings structure with wp_query. Though it is a bit rough around the edges at this time, it is fully functional, and I intend to maintain and develop this project as an opensource project for some time to come. At this time the plugin may be a bit advanced for standard users as it will require knowledge of wp_query (but its really not that hard if you check into it), I would only suggest this for developers or advanced users. It sure grow in features soon enough, but is already structured for you to create your own display templates and css. If you do not already have jquery installed, you may need to install it as I do not include it in this plugin as most modern versions of wordpress already include jquery.
